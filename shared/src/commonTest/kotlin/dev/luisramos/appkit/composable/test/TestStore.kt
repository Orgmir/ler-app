An effect returned for this action is still running. It must complete before the end of
the test.

To fix, inspect any effects the reducer returns for this action and ensure that all of
them complete by the end of the test. There are a few reasons why an effect may not have
completed:

• If an effect uses a scheduler (via "receive", "delay", "debounce", etc.), make
sure that you wait enough time for the scheduler to perform the effect. If you are using
a test scheduler, advance the scheduler so that the effects may complete, or consider
using an immediate scheduler to immediately perform the effect instead.

• If you are returning a long-living effect (timers, notifications, subjects, etc.),
then make sure those effects are torn down.
